# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.
# see ssh_config for more information. this file provides defaults for user
# the values can be changed  in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

# configuration data is parsed as follows:
# 1- command line options
# 2- user-specific file
# 3- system-wide file
# any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuation file and defaults at the end

# site-wide defaults for some commonly use options. for a comprehensive
# list of available options their meanings and defaults
# see the ssh_config man page
